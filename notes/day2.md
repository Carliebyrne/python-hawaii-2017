# Lecturer notes for Day 2

## Recap

* Starting Jupyter
* Variables
* Numbers and strings
* Lists


## Built-in functions

* What are functions
* How to use them (print)
* All functions return
* `min`, `max`, `round`, `len`
* Looking at the help


## The power of libraries

* What are libraries
* Using import and import as
* math (can't operate on lists)
* Use requests to download Hawaii data


## numpy

* numpy (operate on a bunch of data)
* Creating and operating on arrays
* Load sample data and explain a 2D array
    * Exercise: Calculate the min, max, mean, and std of the temperature column

### Exercise

Write code that:

* Reads in the Hawaii temperature data using numpy
* Calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of the
  temperature anomaly


## Making plots with matplotlib

* Matplotlib and a basic plot
* Example using sample data
* Show docs and gallery
    * Exercise: Add labels and a title to your plot
