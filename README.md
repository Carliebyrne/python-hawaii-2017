# Introduction to Python Workshop at UH Manoa

**Instructor:** [Leonardo Uieda](http://www.leouieda.com)

**When**:


**Where**:


**What**:
We will teach a hands-on introduction to the [Python](https://www.python.org/)
programming language.
You **will not** calculate Fibonacci numbers, organize lists of names, print
all odd numbers between 0 and 30, or any of that programmer nonsense.
You **will** load data, perform linear regressions, make figures and maps, and
other things that you will actually need to do on a daily basis.

**Bring**:
Students must bring their own computers (Mac, Windows, or Linux) with the
required software already installed (see [What to install](what-to-install)
below).
[Contact me](http://www.leouieda.com/contact/) if you need any help **before**
the workshop.


## Goals

This is going to be a hands-on workshop of the basic concepts you'll need to
use Python for your research and studies.
Students who complete the workshop should be able to use Python to gather data 
from one or more files, process the data, run an analysis, make publication 
quality figures, and save the output.

## Recommended Literature

We will loosely follow the Python lessons from
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/).
I highly recommend taking a look at all of their material. 
Everything there is worth learning.
