# Python + git Workshop at UH Manoa

**Instructor:** [Leonardo Uieda](http://www.leouieda.com)

**When**:


**Where**:


**What**:
We will teach a hands-on introduction to the [Python](https://www.python.org/)
programming language and the version control system
[git](https://git-scm.com/).
You **will not** calculate Fibonacci numbers, organize lists of names, print
all odd numbers between 0 and 30, or any of that programmer nonsense.
You **will** load data, perform linear regressions, make figures and maps, and
other things that will actually need to do on a daily basis.

**Bring**:
Students must bring their own computers (Mac, Windows, or Linux) with the
required software already installed (see [What to install](what-to-install)
below).
[Contact me](http://www.leouieda.com/contact/) if you need any help **before**
the workshop.


## Goals

This is going to be a hands-on workshop of the basic concepts you'll need to
use git and Python for your research and studies.
Students who complete the workshop should be able to immediately apply the
following concepts to their projects:

* Use git to track changes to a project, revert to a previous version, and
  collaborate on a project through Github.
* Use Python gather data from one or more files, process the data, make
  publication quality figures, and save the output.

## Recommended Literature

We will loosely follow the Python and git lessons from
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/).
I highly recommend taking a look at all of their material. Everything there is
worth learning.
