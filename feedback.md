# Participant feedback

This is a synthesis from the feedback given by participants on the last day (using the pink and blue sticky notes).

| The Good |    |  The Bad  |    |
|:---------|:--:|:----------|:--:|
|Intructor style | 5| Too short |	5|
|Examples and exercises |	5| Too fast| 	3|
|Dense but efficient (learn a lot in little time) |	3	| Too slow	|3|
|Using real data| 3	| Hard to multitask (pay attention + notes + exercise)|	2|
|Simple and accessible level |	3	| No TA on Monday|	2|
|Shared notes | 1	| Too many tangents	|1|
|          |    | Too many people	|1|
|          |    | Ran late	|1|
|          |    | Jupyter Google maps example failed	|1|

I was glad to see that the hands-on approach worked and
the students appreciated using real data during the exercises.

We had very little time (6h total) to cover a lot of material.
So it's no wonder that people thought it was too short
and maybe didn't explain quite as thoroughly some concepts
(like `for` and `if`).
Regarding the pace, it's hard to satisfy everyone.
I expect that novices might have found the pace a bit too fast
and more experienced programmers found it too slow 
(but I don't have data to back that up).
Since only 6 people complained about the pace, I guess
it wasn't too bad.
Not having a TA on Monday (the first day) was not good
because that is when the most serious problems occur 
(Jupyter won't start, where is my Python?, lost my files, etc).
The next two days of the workshop were much smoother
thanks to the generous help of volunteer TAs
Sam Murphy and Julie Schnurr.

We also didn't get to cover the last few topics on the last day
(functions and getting data from headers).

Overall, I think it was a good experience and I'm pleased with the
end result. 
I like to think that we achieved the goals:

> Participants who complete the workshop should be able to use Python to gather data from one or more files, process the data, run an analysis, make publication quality figures, and save the output.

At the very least, the participants now know enough to google for more.
