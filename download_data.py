"""
This script downloads temperature measurements from http://berkeleyearth.org
(country mean) for all available countries listed in "countries.txt" plus the
data for Hawaii.

It uses the library "requests" to perform HTTP GET requests to the server and
get the respective data file. We have to do some clever manipulations because
the data files are encoded using Latin1 instead of Unicode. And life is so much
nicer when everything is Unicode.

All data files are placed in the "data" folder.
